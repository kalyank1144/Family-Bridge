## Summary
Implements the complete Elder user interface with an accessibility-first, voice-driven design. Focuses on reducing cognitive load for seniors while preserving rich functionality and caregiver visibility.

## Changes Since `main`
- Add Elder Home Dashboard with large greeting, weather widget, and four primary action cards
- Implement Emergency Contacts with one‑tap 911 and large call buttons (+ voice command: "Call [name]")
- Build Medication Reminder flow with photo verification, take/skip actions, and caregiver compliance logs
- Create Daily Check‑in with emoji mood scale, simple yes/no questions, pain scale, and 30s voice note
- Add Family Chat with read‑aloud, voice to text, and large tap targets
- Introduce centralized Elder state provider with Supabase realtime subscriptions
- Add voice services (TTS/STT) for screen announcements, confirmations, error states, and global voice shortcuts
- Establish high‑contrast elder theme meeting WCAG AAA and minimum font/touch sizes
- Prepare offline caching and local notification scheduling stubs

## Why
- Seniors benefit from simplified navigation, clear visual hierarchy, and hands‑free interaction
- Caregivers require reliable compliance tracking and realtime status
- Aligns with project goals of safety, connection, and ease of use

## Screens Implemented
- Elder Home Dashboard (`ElderHomeScreen`)
- Emergency Contacts (`EmergencyContactsScreen`)
- Medication Reminder (`MedicationReminderScreen`)
- Daily Check‑in (`DailyCheckinScreen`)
- Family Chat (`FamilyChatScreen`)

## Accessibility
- Font sizes: 18+ body, 24+ buttons, 36–48 headers
- High contrast color scheme, 60px+ touch targets
- Voice feedback for all critical actions; screen change announcements
- Screen reader friendly semantics and labels

## Voice Shortcuts
- "Help" → Emergency contacts
- "Medicine" → Medication reminders
- "Family" → Chat
- "Check in" → Daily wellness
- "Call [contact name]" → Direct call
- "I took my medicine" → Mark dose taken

## Offline / Realtime
- Local caching for contacts and medication schedule
- Queue check‑ins for sync; local notifications
- Supabase realtime subscriptions for medications and messages

## Impact
- New feature set; no breaking changes to other user types
- Adds Flutter dependencies for voice, notifications, and backend

## Testing Notes
- Validate voice commands in quiet environment
- Verify color contrast and tap targets on physical device
- Test offline flows: kill network → perform actions → reconnect → verify sync

## Follow‑ups (separate PRs recommended)
- Wire Supabase credentials/env + production notification scheduling
- Integrate real family chat backend + message receipts
- Expand localization and multi‑language voice
