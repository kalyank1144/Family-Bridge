# Generate HTML report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html

# Open report
open coverage/html/index.html
```

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum: 80% overall
- Critical paths: 95%
- New code: 90%

## 🏃‍♂️ Performance Benchmarks

## 🔐 Security Testing

### HIPAA Compliance Checklist
- ✅ PHI encryption at rest
- ✅ PHI encryption in transit
- ✅ Access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Breach detection
- ✅ Data retention policies

### Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Run security scan
./scripts/security_scan.sh

# Check dependencies
flutter pub outdated
safety check
```

## ♿ Accessibility Testing

### WCAG Compliance
- ✅ Level A: Essential
- ✅ Level AA: Enhanced (Target)
- 🔄 Level AAA: Optimal (Partial)

### Elder-Specific Features
- ✅ Large touch targets (60x60px)
- ✅ High contrast mode
- ✅ Voice navigation
- ✅ Simple language
- ✅ Clear error messages

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Verbose Output
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
flutter test --reporter expanded

# Debug specific test
flutter test --plain-name "should handle emergency"
```

### Interactive Debugging
```bash
# Run with debugger
flutter test --start-paused

# Use breakpoints in IDE
```

## 📝 Writing Tests

### Test Structure
```dart
void main() {
  group('Feature', () {
    setUp(() {
      // Initialize test environment
    });
    
    tearDown(() {
      // Clean up
    });
    
    test('should perform action', () {
      // Arrange
      final service = MockService();
      
      // Act
      final result = service.action();
      
      // Assert
      expect(result, expectedValue);
    });
  });
}
```

### Best Practices
1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, specific test names
2. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
4. **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies
5. **Coverage**: Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100%
6. **Performance**: Keep tests fast (<1s for unit tests)

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - run: flutter test --coverage
```
