# FamilyBridge - Missing Services Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of missing service classes for the FamilyBridge intergenerational care coordination mobile application.

## Overview

FamilyBridge is a comprehensive family care coordination app with three distinct user interfaces:
- **Elder Interface**: Simplified, voice-first design for elderly users
- **Caregiver Dashboard**: Comprehensive monitoring and coordination tools
- **Youth Interface**: Gamified engagement features

## Implemented Services

### 1. AlertService (`/lib/features/caregiver/services/alert_service.dart`)

**Purpose**: Manages caregiver alerts, notifications, and emergency escalation.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time alert creation and management
- Emergency escalation with configurable thresholds
- HIPAA-compliant audit logging
- Offline-first functionality with automatic sync
- Integration with notification system

**Usage Example**:
```dart
final alertService = AlertService();
await alertService.initialize('family-id');

// Create medication alert
final alert = await alertService.createMedicationAlert(
  familyId: 'family-id',
  userId: 'user-id',
  medicationId: 'med-id',
  type: AlertType.medicationMissed,
  medicationName: 'Aspirin',
);

// Acknowledge alert
await alertService.acknowledgeAlert(alert.id, 'caregiver-id');
```

### 2. FamilyDataService (`/lib/features/caregiver/services/family_data_service.dart`)

**Purpose**: Manages family member data, relationships, and coordination.

**Key Features**:
- Family group creation and management
- Member invitation and role assignment
- Granular permission system
- Privacy controls and HIPAA compliance
- Real-time family member updates

**Usage Example**:
```dart
final familyService = FamilyDataService();
await familyService.initialize('user-id');

// Create family
final family = await familyService.createFamily(
  familyName: 'Smith Family',
  createdBy: 'caregiver-id',
);

// Add family member
await familyService.addFamilyMember(
  familyId: family.id,
  userId: 'elder-id',
  role: FamilyRole.elder,
  nickname: 'Grandma',
  relationship: 'Grandmother',
);
```

### 3. MediaService (`/lib/features/chat/services/media_service.dart`)

**Purpose**: Handles photo/media sharing with automatic optimization for elderly users.

**Key Features**:
- Photo capture from camera and gallery
- Automatic optimization for elderly viewing
- Image enhancement (contrast, brightness)
- Text overlay capabilities
- Secure cloud storage with Supabase
- File compression and validation

**Usage Example**:
```dart
final mediaService = MediaService();

// Pick and optimize image for elderly users
final imageFile = await mediaService.pickImageFromGallery(optimizeForElder: true);
if (imageFile != null) {
  final optimizedImage = await mediaService.optimizeImageForElders(imageFile);
  final url = await mediaService.uploadMedia(
    file: optimizedImage,
    bucket: 'family-photos',
    familyId: 'family-id',
    userId: 'user-id',
  );
}
```

### 4. ElderMedicationService (`/lib/features/elder/services/medication_service.dart`)

**Purpose**: Manages elder medication reminders, compliance tracking, and photo verification.

**Key Features**:
- Medication scheduling with multiple reminder times
- Photo verification for medication compliance
- Smart notification management
- Compliance statistics and reporting
- Integration with alert system for missed medications
- Recurring reminder creation

**Usage Example**:
```dart
final medicationService = ElderMedicationService();
await medicationService.initialize('user-id');

// Add medication with photo
final medication = await medicationService.addMedication(
  userId: 'elder-id',
  medicationName: 'Aspirin',
  dosage: '100mg',
  frequency: 'Once daily',
  reminderTimes: ['08:00', '20:00'],
  medicationPhoto: photoFile,
);

// Record medication taken with verification
await medicationService.recordMedicationTaken(
  reminderId: 'reminder-id',
  userId: 'elder-id',
  verificationPhoto: verificationPhoto,
  notes: 'Took with breakfast',
);
```

## Models Implemented

### MedicationReminder (`/lib/features/elder/models/medication_model.dart`)

**Purpose**: Complete medication model with reminder functionality.

**Features**:
- Full CRUD operations with Hive annotations
- Status tracking (pending, taken, missed, snoozed)
- Photo verification support
- Snooze functionality with counters
- Overdue and missed detection logic

## Shared Services

### NotificationService (`/lib/features/shared/services/notification_service.dart`)

**Purpose**: Manages local and push notifications with HIPAA compliance.

**Features**:
- Local notification scheduling
- Push notification delivery
- Permission management
- Notification response handling

### LoggingService (`/lib/features/shared/services/logging_service.dart`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive logging with HIPAA compliance and audit trails.

**Features**:
- Multiple log levels (debug, info, warning, error, critical)
- Audit logging for HIPAA compliance
- Health data access tracking
- Log rotation and archival
- Export capabilities for compliance reporting

## Architecture Patterns

All services follow consistent architectural patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Services use singleton instances for global access
2. **Stream-based Updates**: Real-time data updates using StreamController
3. **Offline-first**: Local caching with automatic sync to Supabase
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
5. **HIPAA Compliance**: Audit logging and privacy controls throughout
6. **Testing Support**: Dependency injection for easy mocking

## Database Integration

Services integrate with Supabase for:
- User authentication and management
- Real-time data synchronization
- File storage and media handling
- Row-level security for privacy

## Testing

Basic unit tests are provided for all services:
- `/test/features/caregiver/alert_service_test.dart`
- `/test/features/caregiver/family_data_service_test.dart`
- `/test/features/elder/medication_service_test.dart`

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase**:
   - Update `lib/main.dart` with your Supabase URL and anon key
   - Set up database tables according to the schema in the specification

3. **Initialize Services**:
   Services are automatically initialized through the Provider pattern in `main.dart`.
